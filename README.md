Flutter Learning Journey 🚀



This repository documents my daily learning journey with Flutter.



The goal is to build strong and solid foundations in Flutter by practicing every day, following a structured roadmap, and creating small projects for each concept.



🎯 Objectives



Learn Flutter step by step, from basics to advanced concepts



Practice daily with real code, not only tutorials



Build discipline and consistency



Prepare for real-world Flutter projects (mobile apps)
